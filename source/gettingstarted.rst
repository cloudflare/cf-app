What is CloudFlare?
-------------------

CloudFlare provides security and performance to websites of all sizes.
Running on a global network, CloudFlare accelerates web traffic and
filters attacks of all kinds before they reaches the site owner’s
server. CloudFlare customers deliver all web traffic to their visitors
through CloudFlare’s network.

CloudFlare numbers
------------------

CloudFlare launched its public service in September, 2010.

As of September, 2012, CloudFlare:

* powers more than 350,000 websites
* delivers more than 2,000,000,000 pageviews daily
* sees visits from more than 550,000,000 unique users monthly

With CloudFlare Apps, you can make your service instantly available to
this audience.

What are CloudFlare Apps?
-------------------------

CloudFlare Apps are services useful to website owners, integrated with a simple dashboard choice on any CloudFlare-powered website.

Two criteria to be a CloudFlare App:

1. Make a website owner’s life better.
2. Take advantage of CloudFlare’s platform.

CloudFlare’s platform is fantastic for many web services and utilities. CloudFlare Apps is not simply to promote outside services; they must be integrated. CloudFlare isn’t promoting services that are not integrated as apps.

Goals of CloudFlare Apps
------------------------

The primary goal of CloudFlare Apps is to make CloudFlare customers happier, by making their websites even better through easy integration of outside services.

Apps may save time, make money or simply bring a smile to a visitor’s face.

Current CloudFlare Apps
-----------------------

Several dozen Apps have been developed in close coordination between
CloudFlare developers and outside developers. More recently,
CloudFlare’s platform has evolved to free developers to work on their
own schedule. These apps all take advantage of the latest iteration of
the platform:

* Trumpet
* EarthHour
* Instaflare
* Visitor DNSChanger Detector
* A Better Browser

What can CloudFlare Apps do?
----------------------------

Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reach website owners who care about making their website better. (see
numbers)

Development via git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use git (public or private repos) to craft and test your App, and make
updates. Versioning supported. Private and public beta testing supported.

Account creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudFlare can create an account on the developer’s service
automatically, via API.

Developer has a relationship with the site owner, even if site owner
leaves CloudFlare.

Default information and app-specific info can be requested or required.

JavaScript deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those apps which integrate JavaScript on to a customer's page, CloudFlare Apps is remarkable. The #1 support problem of most services which need JavaScript deployment is getting the code on the page in the right place – even **after** the customer has paid for the service. CloudFlare does that instantly, in seconds.

CloudFlareJS, the CloudFlare performant loader, allows site owners to install multiple apps without fear of slowing their sites.

Scripts, images, and CSS (if needed) are served from global CDN at no charge.

Global delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudFlare will host and deliver App assets (JavaScript, images, CSS,
and more) from its global network at no charge to App developers. Current network map: http://www.cloudflare.com/network-map

DNS manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*More soon here* CNAME creation, primarily. Other DNS record types possible. Exception: hosting partners/CNAME customers.

Billing
~~~~~~~

CloudFlare provides a billing platform and simply adds App charges to a customer’s existing account.

Options include:
* Monthly (pro-rated) charges
* One-time purchases

Roadmap
-------

-  CSS delivery via CloudFlare global network
-  DNS record creation - capabilities of custom apps
-  Placement - Ability to specify individual DNS records (subdomains,
   for example), directories or even individual pages for App
   deployment. Currently, Apps are deployed site-wide, with exclusion
   possible via Page Rules.
-  Sandbox - Controlled domain and account where developers may view live apps and test their own apps beyond their own domain.
-  Credit card numbers for testing billing end-to-end
-  cloudflare.json linter
