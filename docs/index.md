## Docs

Every app starts with a manifest that describes the app, so reading about the structure of the manifest file is a good place to start. If you are integrating with your web service, then read about the API calls and the Single Sign-on process to seamlessly log-in your app's users right from CloudFlare's dashboard

* [App manifest file (cloudflare.json) structure](/docs/cloudflare-json.html)
* [API calls](/docs/api-calls.html)
* [Single Sign-on](/docs/single-sign-on.html)
* [Loading JavaScript] (/docs/loading-javascript.html)

Your CloudFlare app is encapsulated in a git repo hosted at GitHub and when you are ready to test, submit in the [App Developer Dashboard](https://www.cloudflare.com/app-signup)
