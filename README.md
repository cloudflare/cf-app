## Contributing
New files are created under _source, can use markdown or plain old HTML. Be sure to add the `front matter` at the top, and just write your content part, the container and a title h1 will be automatically added. Take a look at the example page `docs/sample.md`

While hosted on GitHub pages, the source files are auto-generated and served and are not part of the repo.Try editing the sample file on GitHub and save, the generated file should be updated :)
