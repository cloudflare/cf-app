CloudFlare Customers
====================

CloudFlare-powered websites reflects the incredible diversity of the Internet as a whole, in location, content, language and goals.

But all CloudFlare customers share one thing: **they run websites**.

Customers started using CloudFlare because they want to improve performance and security. More generally, they are actively seeking to improve their websites.

Language
--------
CloudFlare customers are more likely to be technical, but clear language, without jargon, helps everyone.

CloudFlare aims to make complicated infrastructure easy to understand and use. We encourage the same of app developers, and may comment on language choice.

While English is often understood by CloudFlare customers, it's not the first language for all customers. Developers must note languages supported in their app interfaces.

CloudFlare's English-language site is our most popular, but we are  expanding our translation efforts to ease signup and operation in other languages. Developers don't need to take any special steps at this time, but we welcome contributions via `CloudFlare's translation portal <http://translate.cloudflare.com>`_, operated by app partner `Smartling <https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/smartling>`_.

DNS
---
Most customers set up CloudFlare by pointing their domain to CloudFlare's global Anycast authoritative DNS. In the future, apps and services which benefit from CNAME creation, for example, may automatically create the necessary CNAMEs with the app install. (Not yet available September 2012.) Customers who set up CloudFlare via their hosting control panel do not move DNS to CloudFlare.
