What is CloudFlare?
-------------------

CloudFlare provides security and performance to websites of all sizes.
Running on a global network, CloudFlare accelerates web traffic and
filters attacks of all kinds before they reaches the site owner’s
server. CloudFlare customers deliver all web traffic to their visitors
through CloudFlare’s network.

CloudFlare reach
----------------

CloudFlare launched its public service in September, 2010.

What are CloudFlare Apps?
-------------------------

CloudFlare Apps are services useful to website owners, integrated with a simple dashboard choice on any CloudFlare-powered website.

Goals of CloudFlare Apps
------------------------

The primary goal of CloudFlare Apps is to make CloudFlare customers happier, by making their websites even better through easy integration of outside services.

Apps may site owners time, make money or simply bring a smile to a visitor’s face.

Current CloudFlare Apps
-----------------------

Dozens of Apps have been developed in close coordination between
CloudFlare developers and outside developers: <https://www.cloudflare.com/apps>

CloudFlare’s platform now supports more independent work, with a fuller toolset, supported by the CloudFlare Apps team.

These apps all take advantage of the latest iteration of the platform:

* `Trumpet <https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/trumpet>`_
* `A Better Browser <https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/abetterbrowser>`_
* `EarthHour <https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/earthhour>`_
* `Instaflare <https://www.cloudflare.com/apps/instaflare>`_
* `Visitor DNSChanger Detector <https://github.com/cloudflare/dnschanger_detector>`_ (repo link, since app was disabled after deadline)

What can CloudFlare Apps do?
----------------------------

Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reach website owners who care about improving their website.

Account creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For outside services, CloudFlare creates an account on the developer’s service automatically, via API.

Default information and app-specific info can be requested or required.

JavaScript deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For those apps which integrate JavaScript on to a customer's page, CloudFlare Apps is remarkable. The #1 support problem of most services which need JavaScript deployment is getting the code on the page in the right place – even **after** the customer has paid for the service. CloudFlare does that instantly, in seconds.

CloudFlareJS, the CloudFlare performant loader, allows site owners to install multiple apps without fear of slowing their sites.

Billing
~~~~~~~

CloudFlare provides a billing platform, simply adding App charges to a customer’s existing account.

Options include:

-  Monthly (pro-rated) charges
-  One-time purchases

Global delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CloudFlare will host and deliver app assets (JavaScript, images, CSS,
and more) from its global network at no charge to app developers. Current network map: http://www.cloudflare.com/network-map

DNS manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CNAME creation, primarily, but other DNS record types possible. Majority of CloudFlare customers use CloudFlare as their global Anycast authoritative DNS provider.

Development via git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use git (public or private repos) to craft and test your App, and make
updates. Versioning supported. Private and public beta testing supported.

Roadmap
-------

-  CSS delivery via CloudFlare global network
-  DNS record creation - capabilities of custom apps
-  Placement - Ability to specify individual DNS records (subdomains,
   for example), directories or even individual pages for App
   deployment. Currently, Apps are deployed site-wide, with exclusion
   possible via Page Rules.
-  Credit card numbers for testing billing end-to-end
-  Sandbox - Controlled domain and account where developers may view live apps and test their own apps beyond their own domain.
-  cloudflare.json linter
