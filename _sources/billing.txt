Billing
=======

CloudFlare Apps are available to all CloudFlare customers, on all domains, ranging from Free to Enterprise.

CloudFlare customers will pay for Apps with the credit card on file with CloudFlare, adding the charge to their existing CloudFlare bill. Billing information will be collected by CloudFlare at app purchase for those customers who don't have a credit card on file.

Plans
-----
CloudFlare Apps supports fixed-price monthly plans. Developer may have as many different plans as they want, including a free plan.

Upgrades and downgrades
-----------------------
CloudFlare supports customer upgrades and downgrades at any time, in the same interface as the original purchase.

If developers' services include upgrade/downgrade options, those links **must** return CloudFlare app customers to the CloudFlare dashboard to complete the upgrade/downgrade.

Changing prices and plans
-------------------------
Developers may change prices and plan offerings with reasonable frequency. It is expected that existing customers will be able to continue service at their existing price with the originally designated services ("grandfathering" the existing customers). If the existing customers change plans, they lose the ability to return to the earlier plan.

Ending service
--------------
If a developer wants to discontinue an app, please contact CloudFlare to discuss, so we can jointly plan how to make the process clear to customers.

Fraud
-----
Fraudulent payments will trigger the app being turned off, with accompany API signal to the developer's endpoint, notifying that subscription is ended.
