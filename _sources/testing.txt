Testing CloudFlare Apps
=======================

Before launch
-------------
Once an app submission has been accepted, a developer can start testing their app in production as soon as a version has been reviewed and promoted to the live network (see `development process` development-process.html`_ for more).

The app detail page and the CloudFlare dashboard controls will be presented behind authentication, and the dashboard controls will only be visible with parameters added to the dashboard URL (more details coming soon).

Developer can iterate with versions, and share testing instructions with other CloudFlare customers as a private beta.

After launch
------------

CloudFlare supports versions. There is only one version "promoted" as the generally available app at any one time, but using parameters, a developer can request different versions on live websites once the versions have been reviewed and approved. (More details coming soon.)
